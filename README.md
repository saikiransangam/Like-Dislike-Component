# Like-Dislike-Component
A like-dislike react component is a user interface element built using the React JavaScript library that allows a user to indicate whether they like or dislike something.

This component can be used in a variety of contexts, such as rating a product or article, or providing feedback on a piece of content.

The like-dislike react component typically consists of two buttons or icons, one representing a "like" and the other representing a "dislike." The user can click on the appropriate button to indicate their preference. The component may also display a count of the total number of likes and dislikes received.

The like-dislike react component can be implemented using a variety of technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It may be integrated with a server-side component to persist the likes and dislikes and provide analytics on the user feedback.
